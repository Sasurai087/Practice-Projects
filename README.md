# Simple Expenses Tracking App
This project utilizes React Hooks and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Tracks user expenses, filters them by year, and shows a chart indicating which month had the highest expenses relative to other months.

Users can add their own expenses by toggling a submission form via the 'Add New Expense' button at the top, then inputting values into the title, amount, and date fields.
